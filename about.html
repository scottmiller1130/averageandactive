    <h1>Built for the <em>rest of us.</em></h1>
    <p>I'm not a coach. I'm not an influencer. I'm a dad of three girls who got tired of fitness content that wasn't made for people like me.</p>

  <!-- THE STORY -->

        <div class="section-label">The Short Version</div>
        <h2>I'm a husband, a dad, and a guy <em>trying to stay fit</em> through all of it.</h2>
        <p>I have three daughters — a ten-year-old, a seven-year-old, and an eight-month-old. I work a full-time job. I wake up at 5:45 AM to get the day going with my family, and I squeeze in workouts on my lunch break or after work when I can.</p>
        <p>I got tired of scrolling through fitness content made by peak athletes in their twenties with no kids and unlimited time. I respect their grind, but it's not my reality. My reality is fitting in a workout between meetings and bedtime routines.</p>
        <p>Average &amp; Active is me documenting that journey. Not for clout or followers, but because I figured if I was going through it, other people probably were too. No products to sell, no programs to push — just what it actually looks like to stay active as a regular person with a full life.</p>

        <div class="value-card fade-in"><div class="value-icon">🪞</div><h3>Show All of It</h3><p>The bad days alongside the good. The missed workouts, the stress eating, the setbacks. Pretending it's easy helps no one.</p></div>
        <div class="value-card fade-in"><div class="value-icon">📏</div><h3>Progress Over Perfection</h3><p>Done is better than perfect. A 20-minute walk beats a skipped gym session. Consistency trumps intensity every single time.</p></div>
        <div class="value-card fade-in"><div class="value-icon">👨‍👧</div><h3>Family First, Always</h3><p>Fitness exists to make life better — not to take over your life. If the kids need me, the barbell can wait.</p></div>
        <div class="value-card fade-in"><div class="value-icon">🌱</div><h3>Play the Long Game</h3><p>I'm not training for summer. I'm training for the next 40 years. Every decision is measured against longevity.</p></div>
        <div class="value-card fade-in"><div class="value-icon">🚫</div><h3>No Products, No Ads</h3><p>I don't sell programs or gatekeep information. Everything I learn, I share. You don't need more ads. You need more content that matters.</p></div>
        <div class="value-card fade-in"><div class="value-icon">🤝</div><h3>Keep It Real</h3><p>No filters, no perfect lighting, no highlight reels. Nothing happens fast. It takes work, consistency, and time.</p></div>

        The Bottom Line
      </div>
      <h2>I believe <em>80% is just showing up.</em> That a dad who walks every day is fitter than a gym bro who goes hard for two weeks and quits. That <em>sustainability beats intensity</em> every time.</h2>
      <p>Average &amp; Active is for anyone who's ever felt too out of shape to start, too busy to be consistent, or too real for the highlight-reel fitness world. You're in the right place.</p>
