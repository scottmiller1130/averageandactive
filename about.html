    <div class="section-label">Our Story</div>
    <h1>Built for the <em>rest of us.</em></h1>
    <p>We're not coaches. We're not influencers. We're parents who got tired of fitness content that wasn't made for people like us.</p>

  <!-- THE STORY -->

        <div class="section-label">The Beginning</div>
        <h2>It started with a <em>garage gym</em> and a decision.</h2>
        <p>Like a lot of parents, I let fitness slide. The kids came, the career got busy, and suddenly I was winded playing tag in the backyard. That moment — gasping for air while my 5-year-old laughed and ran circles around me — was the wake-up call.</p>
        <p>I didn't hire a coach or buy a program. I cleared out half the garage, bought some dumbbells, and started showing up at 5AM before the house woke up. It wasn't pretty. It wasn't optimized. But it was mine.</p>
        <p>Average &amp; Active started as a way to document that journey. Not for clout or followers, but because I figured if I was going through it, other parents probably were too. Turns out — a lot of us are.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Our values aren't aspirational — they're lived.</h2>
      <p class="section-subtitle">These aren't motivational posters. These are the principles we actually follow every day.</p>
      <div class="values-grid">
        <div class="value-card fade-in"><div class="value-icon">🪞</div><h3>Radical Honesty</h3><p>We show the bad days alongside the good. The missed workouts, the stress eating, the setbacks. Because pretending it's easy helps no one.</p></div>
        <div class="value-card fade-in"><div class="value-icon">📏</div><h3>Progress Over Perfection</h3><p>Done is better than perfect. A 20-minute walk beats a skipped gym session. Consistency trumps intensity every single time.</p></div>
        <div class="value-card fade-in"><div class="value-icon">👨‍👧</div><h3>Family First, Always</h3><p>Fitness exists to make life better — not to take over your life. If the kids need you, the barbell can wait.</p></div>
        <div class="value-card fade-in"><div class="value-icon">🌱</div><h3>Long Game Thinking</h3><p>We're not training for summer. We're training for the next 40 years. Every decision is measured against longevity.</p></div>
        <div class="value-card fade-in"><div class="value-icon">🚫</div><h3>No Gatekeeping</h3><p>We don't sell programs or gatekeep information. Everything we learn, we share. Knowledge should be free.</p></div>
        <div class="value-card fade-in"><div class="value-icon">🤝</div><h3>Community Over Competition</h3><p>We're not here to out-lift each other. We're here to pull each other up. Your win is our win.</p></div>

        The Manifesto
      </div>
      <h2>We believe <em>80% is just showing up.</em> That a dad who walks every day is fitter than a gym bro who goes hard for two weeks and quits. That <em>sustainability beats intensity</em> every time.</h2>
      <p>Average &amp; Active is for anyone who's ever felt too out of shape to start, too busy to be consistent, or too real for the highlight-reel fitness world. You're in the right place.</p>
