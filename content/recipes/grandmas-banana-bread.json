  "ingredients": [
    "4 ripe bananas, mashed",
    "1/2 cup margarine or butter, softened",
    "3 eggs, beaten",
    "2 cups sugar",
    "1 cup milk mixed with 2 tablespoons vinegar (buttermilk substitute)",
    "3 cups flour, sifted with 1 teaspoon baking soda",
    "1 cup chopped walnuts"
  ],
  "steps": [
    "Preheat your oven to 350°F. Grease and flour two standard loaf pans.",
    "Mash the bananas in a large bowl with a fork until mostly smooth — a few small chunks are fine.",
    "Mix the milk and vinegar together in a small bowl or measuring cup and set it aside for a few minutes to curdle into a buttermilk substitute.",
    "In a large mixing bowl, cream the softened butter and sugar together until combined.",
    "Add the beaten eggs and mashed bananas to the butter-sugar mixture and stir until well mixed.",
    "Sift the flour and baking soda together, then add to the wet ingredients alternately with the milk-vinegar mixture, stirring until just combined. Do not overmix.",
    "Fold in the chopped walnuts. Or make it your own — skip the nuts entirely, swap in pecans, add a cup of chocolate chips, or mix in whatever sounds good to you. The batter handles it all.",
    "Divide the batter evenly between the two prepared loaf pans.",
    "Bake at 350°F for 1 hour, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.",
    "Let the loaves cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely before slicing."
