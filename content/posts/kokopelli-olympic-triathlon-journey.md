I did a sprint triathlon. It was hard, it was humbling, and I loved it. So naturally, the next question was — can I go further? The answer is I don't know. But I'm going to find out.

The Kokopelli Olympic Triathlon in Hurricane, Utah on September 26 is the goal. That's a 1,500 meter swim, a 20.7 mile bike, and a 6.2 mile run. Roughly double the sprint distance across the board. It's a real step up, and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't nervous about it.

But that's the point of this whole thing. Average and active means pushing into uncomfortable territory — not recklessly, but intentionally. I want to see what this body can do when I put in the work.

## Why Kokopelli

I spent a while looking at races and this one checked every box.

**It's drivable.** I can pack my bike in the car, load up the family, and road trip out to Utah. No flying with a bike box, no shipping logistics, no stress about gear arriving in one piece. Just load up and go.

**Lower elevation.** Sand Hollow Reservoir sits at about 3,000 feet. Coming from Colorado, that's a gift. Training at elevation and racing lower is the advantage I'll take wherever I can get it.

**The timing works.** Race day is late September, which gives me a full training block starting April 1. That's roughly six months of focused preparation. Enough time to build properly without rushing it.

**Family trip built in.** This was a big factor. Zion National Park is 30 minutes away. Bryce Canyon is a couple hours out. The Grand Canyon North Rim is within driving distance. Sand Hollow State Park itself has beaches, kayaking, paddleboarding, and even scuba diving over a submerged Volkswagen bus — the kids are going to lose their minds. This isn't just a race weekend, it's a family trip that happens to have a triathlon in the middle of it.

**It's beautiful.** Sand Hollow Reservoir is turquoise water surrounded by red Navajo sandstone. The swim goes through crystal-clear water with red rock islands breaking the surface. The bike and run courses overlook the reservoir the entire way. If I'm going to suffer for a few hours, at least the views will be worth it.

## What I'm Worried About

**The heat.** September in southern Utah means race morning starts in the mid-60s but climbs into the mid-80s or higher by the time I'm on the run. The desert sun is intense, there's minimal shade on the course, and the humidity is low — which sounds nice until you realize you're dehydrating faster than you think. Hydration strategy is going to be a big part of the training plan.

**The swim.** 1,500 meters in open water is a different animal than 750. Historically, the water temperature at Sand Hollow in late September hovers around 77-78 degrees — right on the edge of wetsuit legal. The race director measures it at packet pickup and makes the call. I'm hoping it's wetsuit legal because the added buoyancy helps, but I need to train for both scenarios. The race has a Care Cap program for athletes who are nervous in open water — I respect that they offer it, and honestly, doubling my swim distance in a reservoir is going to require some mental prep.

**The bike.** The course has about 791 feet of climbing over 20.7 miles. It's an out-and-back along Sand Hollow Road, which means whatever you climb going out, you get back coming in. There's a decent hill that's going to test the legs, especially knowing a 10K run comes after. Fun.

## The Plan

Training kicks up on April 1. Between now and then, I'm in recovery mode, building my base back up, and staying consistent with the fundamentals — zone 2 cardio, strength work, mobility.

Once April hits, the structured training begins. I'll be following a plan that builds volume gradually across all three disciplines. The swim needs the most work. The bike is where I feel strongest. The run is where I'll need to be smart about pacing, especially in the heat.

I'm going to post the whole journey. The training weeks, the brick workouts, the open water swims that scare me, the long rides, the days where it clicks and the days where it doesn't. The good and the bad. That's what average and active is about — showing the real process, not just the finish line photo.

## Why This Matters

Triathlon has a reputation for being an elite sport. Expensive gear, perfect bodies, Ironman bumper stickers. And sure, that world exists. But so does the world where a dad with a desk job decides to see what he's capable of. Where the goal isn't a podium finish — it's crossing the line and knowing you earned it.

I have no idea what my time will be. I have no idea if race day will go perfectly or fall apart. But I know that six months from now, I'll be standing at Sand Hollow Reservoir at sunrise, looking at that turquoise water against the red rock, and I'll be ready to find out.

September 26. Kokopelli. Let's go.
