I'm not going to pretend I wake up every morning fired up and ready to crush a workout. Some days, the alarm goes off at 4:55 AM and every part of me wants to stay in bed. But I get up anyway. And that's kind of the whole point.

## Why 5AM?

I didn't choose 5AM because I'm a morning person. I chose it because it's the only time that's truly mine. By 6:30, the kids are up. By 7:15, we're in full breakfast-backpack-bus-stop chaos. If I don't train before the house wakes up, it's not happening.

The garage gym helps too. No commute to a gym means I roll out of bed, throw on shorts, and I'm already there. The barrier to entry is literally just standing up.

## The Actual Routine

I keep it simple. Four days a week, alternating between upper and lower body. Each session is 35-45 minutes. Here's what a typical week looks like:

- Monday: Upper body (push focus) — bench press, overhead press, rows, curls
- Tuesday: Lower body — squats, Romanian deadlifts, lunges, calf raises
- Thursday: Upper body (pull focus) — pull-ups, dumbbell rows, face pulls, triceps
- Friday: Lower body + conditioning — deadlifts, leg press, kettlebell swings

Wednesday is a rest day or a light walk. Weekends are for family hikes, backyard play, or just resting. No guilt.

## What Made It Stick

Three things changed everything for me:

- I stopped chasing perfection. A 20-minute session beats a skipped one.
- I laid out my clothes the night before. Removes one more decision.
- I tracked consistency, not weight. My goal is 4 sessions per week, not a PR.

The first two weeks were brutal. But after that, it became automatic. Now it feels weird NOT to train in the morning.

## The Honest Truth

I still have bad days. Last week I slept through my alarm twice. The week before, my kid was sick and I was up all night. Life happens. The difference is I don't let one missed day turn into a missed week anymore.

If you're thinking about starting a morning routine — start smaller than you think. Even 15 minutes. The habit of showing up matters more than the workout itself.
