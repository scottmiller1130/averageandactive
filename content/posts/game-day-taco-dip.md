Some foods just hit different because of when you ate them. This taco dip is one of those for me. Every time IU basketball was on — and if you grew up in Indiana, you know that was a big deal — this dip was on the table. Big platter, bag of chips, the whole family parked in front of the TV. It didn't matter if we were ranked or getting blown out. The dip showed up.

I've made this for years now and it's still the first thing I think of when game day rolls around. It's not fancy. It's not trying to be. It's the kind of appetizer that a room full of people will demolish before the second quarter, and someone will always ask you for the recipe — even though there's barely a recipe to give.

## Why This One Works

I'll be honest — most game day food is a nutritional disaster. And look, I'm not here to ruin the party. But this dip actually has some things going for it. The base is refried beans, which give you fiber and protein. The second layer is Greek yogurt mixed with taco seasoning instead of sour cream — same tangy flavor, way better macros. And then you load it up with vegetables. You're basically eating a salad with a really good delivery system.

Is it health food? No. But it's a lot better than most of what you'll find at a watch party, and nobody is going to complain that it's "healthy." That's the sweet spot.

## The Build

You need a large platter. Not a bowl — a platter. The whole point is thin layers with maximum surface area so every chip gets a little bit of everything. Here's how it goes:

- Layer 1: One can of refried beans, spread thin across the platter. This is the foundation.
- Layer 2: Greek yogurt mixed with a packet of taco seasoning. Spread it right over the beans.
- Layer 3: All the toppings — diced tomatoes, green peppers, onions, sliced black olives, shredded cheese, and lettuce on top.
- Serve with tortilla chips. That's it. That's the whole thing.

## Make It Your Own

The beauty of this dip is that it's flexible. Want some heat? Throw some sliced jalapeños on there. Got green onions? Slice them up and scatter them across the top. Cilantro, hot sauce, a squeeze of lime — go for it. I've seen people add guacamole as a layer too, and I'm not mad about it.

The base stays the same — beans, seasoned yogurt, toppings. Everything else is just personal preference. My kids pick around the olives. My wife loads up on the tomatoes. I put hot sauce on mine. Everyone gets what they want off the same platter.

## The Greek Yogurt Move

If you've never swapped Greek yogurt for sour cream, this is your sign. Mixed with taco seasoning, you genuinely cannot tell the difference. It's tangy, it's creamy, and it adds protein instead of just fat. I use plain nonfat or 2% Greek yogurt. Once the taco seasoning is mixed in, nobody's asking questions. They're just eating.

## Game Day Memories

There's something about food that ties you to moments. For me, this dip is Assembly Hall on a Saturday afternoon. It's my family yelling at the TV. It's fighting over the last scoop on the platter. Now I'm making it for my own family during games, and my kids are starting to associate it with the same thing. That's the kind of stuff that sticks.

It takes 15 minutes to throw together, it feeds a crowd, and it never lasts long. If you need a game day appetizer, this is it. Stop overthinking it. Spread the beans, mix the yogurt, pile on the toppings, and go watch the game.
