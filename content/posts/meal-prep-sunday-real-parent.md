Every meal prep guide I've seen assumes you have 4 hours, 30 containers, and zero children. Here's my version — the one that actually works when you've got a 90-minute window while the kids are doing quiet time.

## The 90-Minute Game Plan

I don't prep every meal for the week. I prep the things that, if I don't have ready, will lead me to order takeout. That means: protein, grains, and a few snacks.

## What I Actually Prep

- 2 lbs chicken breast — seasoned and baked (used in bowls, wraps, salads all week)
- A big pot of rice or quinoa
- Cut vegetables — peppers, cucumbers, cherry tomatoes
- Hard-boiled eggs (a dozen)
- Overnight oats for 3 mornings (oats, protein powder, milk, chia seeds in jars)

## The Family Crossover

Here's the trick: most of what I prep works for the whole family. The chicken goes into the kids' quesadillas. The rice goes with their dinner. I'm not making two separate meals — I'm making building blocks that everyone can use differently.

Dinners are still cooked fresh most nights — usually something simple like sheet pan chicken and veggies, turkey tacos, or pasta. The prep just handles lunches and breakfasts so I'm not scrambling every morning.

## My Advice

Don't try to be a meal prep influencer. You don't need 15 matching containers and a color-coded menu. Just cook some protein, cook some carbs, and cut some vegetables. That's 80% of the battle right there.
