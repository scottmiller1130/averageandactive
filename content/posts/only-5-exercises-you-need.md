The fitness industry wants you to think you need 47 different exercises, a periodized program, and a PhD in kinesiology. You don't. If you're a parent just trying to stay healthy and functional, here are the only five movements that matter.

## 1. Squat

Barbell, goblet, bodyweight — doesn't matter. Squatting keeps your legs strong, your knees healthy, and your ability to get off the floor intact as you age. I do goblet squats with a dumbbell 2x per week. Nothing fancy.

## 2. Hinge (Deadlift)

Picking heavy stuff off the ground. This builds your back, glutes, and hamstrings — the muscles that protect your spine when you're lifting kids, groceries, or furniture. Romanian deadlifts with dumbbells are my go-to.

## 3. Push (Bench Press / Push-Ups)

Upper body pushing. Bench press, push-ups, overhead press — pick one or rotate. This keeps your chest, shoulders, and arms strong for carrying kids, pushing strollers, and everyday life.

## 4. Pull (Rows / Pull-Ups)

The counterbalance to all that pushing (and all that sitting at a desk). Rows and pull-ups build the back muscles that keep your posture solid. I do dumbbell rows every upper body day.

## 5. Carry (Farmer's Walk)

Grab two heavy dumbbells and walk. That's it. This builds grip strength, core stability, and total body endurance. It's also the most 'real life' exercise there is — when was the last time you carried a sleeping child plus three bags of groceries up the stairs?

## The Bottom Line

Master these five movements and you're set. You don't need fancy equipment, a gym membership, or a complicated program. Just these five, done consistently, with gradual progress. That's the whole recipe.
