# My Home Gym Setup: Everything I Use (And What's Actually Worth It)

*Real talk about the equipment that keeps this dad moving — no sponsorships, no BS.*

---

If you've ever thought about building a home gym, you've probably fallen down the rabbit hole of "ultimate setup" videos from people with $50K garage gyms and lighting rigs that belong on a film set. That's not this post.

This is what a real home gym looks like when you're a parent, you train around nap times and work calls, and you need gear that earns its square footage. I've built mine out over time, and every piece in here has to justify its spot. Here's the full rundown.

## The Rack: REP Ares 2.0

This is the centerpiece. If you're only going to invest in one big piece of equipment, make it a quality rack — and the REP Ares 2.0 has been worth every penny.

Mine came with the pull-up bar, safety straps, and a large squat area, which covers about 80% of what I need for strength training. Squats, bench press, overhead press, pull-ups, rack pulls — it all happens here. The safety straps are a non-negotiable when you're training solo. Nobody's spotting me on my lunch break, and I'm not about to get pinned under a bar between meetings.

Here's the thing nobody talks about enough: if you're an endurance athlete, you still need to be lifting. Muscle mass doesn't just stick around — you lose it as you age, and all that cardio volume from tri training isn't doing you any favors on the preservation front. A solid rack makes it easy to keep the big compound lifts in your routine, even during heavy training blocks. That's how you stay strong and functional for the long haul, not just the next race.

## Concept 2 Rower & SkiErg

These two are the cardio backbone of my gym. If you know, you know — Concept 2 basically wrote the book on rowing machines, and there's a reason they're everywhere.

The **rower** is my go-to for steady-state cardio, warm-ups, and those days when I need to move but my legs are toast from yesterday's squats or a long ride. It's also a full-body workout disguised as "just cardio," which is sneaky efficient when you're short on time. For triathlon training, it's a great low-impact way to build aerobic capacity without adding more run or bike volume to already tired legs.

The **SkiErg** is a different beast. It hammers your upper body and core in a way that nothing else really replicates. I use it for intervals and upper body conditioning — and it translates surprisingly well to the swim portion of tri training. That pulling pattern and the demand on your lats and shoulders carries over more than you'd think. It also takes up almost no floor space since it mounts to the wall — big win in a home gym.

**Worth noting:** Both of these hold their resale value like crazy. If you ever decide to move on, you'll get most of your money back. That's rare for fitness equipment.

## The Hex (Trap) Bar

If I could only do one lower body movement for the rest of my life, hex bar deadlifts would be in the conversation. It's more forgiving on your lower back than a straight bar, the learning curve is way shorter, and you can load it heavy without worrying as much about form breaking down when you're fatigued.

From a longevity standpoint, this is one of the best tools in the gym. You're training your posterior chain, grip strength, and total body tension — all things that decline with age if you don't stay on top of them. And for a dad who's been sitting at a desk all day before squeezing in a workout, the hex bar lets you pull heavy with less risk. That matters when the goal is still being able to do this stuff in your 50s, 60s, and beyond.

## Kettlebells

I've got a set of kettlebells and they're some of the most versatile pieces in the gym. Swings, goblet squats, Turkish get-ups, farmer carries, cleans — the list doesn't end. They're also perfect for those days when you've got 20 minutes and need to get after it with minimal transition time.

What I really appreciate about kettlebells is how well they build the kind of functional, durable strength that actually ages well. Hip hinges, loaded carries, single-leg work — this is the stuff that keeps you moving well as the years add up. Not flashy, but incredibly effective.

If you're starting out, a single kettlebell in the right weight can keep you busy for months before you even think about adding another.

## Adjustable Dumbbells

I'll be honest — mine are starting to show their age. The adjustment mechanism is wearing thin, and they're on the list for an upgrade. But adjustable dumbbells are still one of the smartest purchases you can make for a home gym. They replace an entire dumbbell rack in a fraction of the space.

When they work well, they're perfect for accessory work, isolation movements, and filling in the gaps that barbells miss. Think single-arm rows, lateral raises, chest flyes — the stuff that keeps your shoulders healthy and your stabilizers strong, especially when you're putting in big swim, bike, and run volume. Just know that the moving parts *will* wear over time, especially if you're using them hard and often. Something to factor into your budget — they're not a buy-it-once-forever piece like a Concept 2.

## 70lb Slam Ball

This thing is pure therapy. Bad day at work? Slam ball. Kids tested every last nerve? Slam ball. Need to build some explosive power? Also slam ball.

At 70 pounds, it's no joke. Slam ball work builds power, core strength, and conditioning all at once. It's also one of the few pieces of equipment where you're actively encouraged to throw it as hard as you can into the ground. Very cathartic. Highly recommend.

And from a longevity perspective — explosive power is one of the first things to go as you age. Rate of force development drops off faster than raw strength does. Keeping some power work in your routine, even just slam balls a couple times a week, is an investment in your future self.

## The Treadmill

This is the newest addition to the gym — just added it about a week ago — and I'm already wondering why I waited so long. Nobody's posting treadmill content that goes viral. But having one in the gym means I never have an excuse to skip a run. Weather's bad? Treadmill. It's dark and icy outside? Treadmill. Need to do intervals and control the pace precisely? Treadmill.

For tri training, I can already tell this is going to get a lot of use. Structured run sessions where I need to hit specific paces, bad weather days where I'd otherwise skip — it just removes the excuses. And the thing I'm most looking forward to is stacking a run onto the back of a bike session for brick workouts. Having it ten feet away from the trainer is going to be pretty clutch once tri season ramps up.

The other big one — I train at 6,200 feet. Running outside at altitude with hills means my heart rate is all over the place, which makes it really hard to train in specific zones. The treadmill lets me control the terrain and the climate, keep my heart rate where it needs to be, and actually dial in my training instead of just guessing. At elevation, that kind of control matters more than most people realize.

## The Bike Trainer: Wahoo + Zwift Setup

This one lives in the spare room, and it deserves its own post at some point. The Wahoo trainer paired with Zwift has been a game-changer for tri training. Being able to hop on and ride structured workouts or jump into a group ride without leaving the house is massive when you've got a family schedule to work around.

Zwift makes indoor riding way more tolerable than staring at a wall, and the structured training plans are legit. It's also nice having it in a separate room — keeps the gym feeling like a gym and the bike space feeling like its own zone where I can lock in.

For anyone juggling family life and triathlon, an indoor setup like this isn't optional — it's how training actually happens consistently.

## The Honest Truth About Building a Home Gym

I didn't buy all of this at once. It's been built up piece by piece, usually when I found a good deal or identified a real gap in my training. The best advice I can give is: **start with what supports the training you actually do**, not the training you think you *should* do.

A rack, some free weights, and one solid cardio machine will get most people further than they think. Everything else is a bonus.

My training is built around two things: triathlon and keeping muscle on my frame for as long as possible. Those might sound like they're at odds with each other, but they're not — you just have to be intentional. The endurance work keeps my heart and lungs healthy. The strength work keeps my body resilient, protects my joints, and makes sure I'm not just a skinny dude who can run far. Both matter if the goal is being active and capable for decades, not just for the next race.

And if you're a parent reading this — a home gym isn't a luxury. It's logistics. It's the difference between "I'll go to the gym after bedtime" (which never happens) and actually getting it done. That's worth the investment.
