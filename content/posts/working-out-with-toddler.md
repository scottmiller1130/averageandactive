Let me paint you a picture: I'm mid-squat, barbell on my back, and my 3-year-old decides this is the perfect moment to show me her drawing. Of a cat. That needs a name. Right now.

If you're a parent who trains at home, you know exactly what I'm talking about. Here's how I've learned to make it work.

## Accept the Chaos

Step one: let go of the idea of an uninterrupted 45-minute session. It's not happening. Once I accepted that, I actually started enjoying the absurdity of it. My daughter does 'squats' next to me with a pool noodle. My son counts my reps (inaccurately). It's messy and kind of perfect.

## Strategies That Actually Help

- Use rest periods for kid stuff — answer the question, fix the snack, find the toy
- Pick exercises that are safe to bail on (dumbbells > barbell when kids are around)
- Set up a 'kid station' nearby with coloring books, blocks, or a tablet
- Keep sessions short and intense — 25 minutes of focus beats 60 minutes of distraction
- Let them participate. Kid-sized dumbbells cost $10 and buy you infinite goodwill

## The Real Lesson

Working out with your kids around isn't a limitation — it's modeling behavior. They see you prioritizing your health. They see you pushing through something hard. They see you showing up even when it's not easy. That's a lesson no amount of talking can teach.
