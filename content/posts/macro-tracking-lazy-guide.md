I tried strict macro tracking for about three weeks before I wanted to throw my phone into a lake. Weighing every almond? Scanning every barcode? That's not sustainable when you're also packing lunches and negotiating with a 4-year-old about eating vegetables.

## The 'Close Enough' Method

Here's what I actually do: I track roughly. I know what a palm-sized portion of protein looks like. I know a fist of carbs. A thumb of fat. Is it accurate to the gram? No. Is it accurate enough to make progress? Absolutely.

## My Daily Targets (Roughly)

- Protein: 150-180g (I aim for 40g per meal, 4 times a day)
- Carbs: 200-250g (more on training days, less on rest days)
- Fats: 60-70g (this usually takes care of itself)
- Total: ~2,200 calories

## The Staples That Make It Easy

I eat roughly the same things during the week. Not because I'm boring — because decision fatigue is real when you have kids. Here are my go-tos:

- Breakfast: Eggs + toast or protein shake + banana
- Lunch: Chicken + rice bowl or turkey wrap
- Dinner: Whatever the family eats (I just adjust my portion)
- Snacks: Greek yogurt, protein bar, apple + almond butter

Weekends are more flexible. We eat out, we have pizza night, we live our lives. I don't track on weekends — I just make generally smart choices and enjoy the time with family.

## The One Non-Negotiable

If there's one thing I'd tell anyone to focus on, it's protein. Hit your protein target and everything else falls into place more easily. You're less hungry, you recover better, and you maintain muscle as you age. That's the whole game.
