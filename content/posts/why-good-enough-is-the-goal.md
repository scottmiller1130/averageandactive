For years, I'd start a fitness plan, go all-in for two or three weeks, and then crash. The plan was always too perfect — 6 workouts a week, meal prep every Sunday, no cheat meals, sleep by 10 PM. Real life doesn't work like that.

## The Shift

The turning point came when I lowered my standards. Not in a giving-up way — in a realistic way. Instead of 6 workouts, I aimed for 3. Instead of perfect nutrition, I aimed for 'mostly good.' Instead of no junk food, I aimed for 80/20.

And something unexpected happened: I actually stuck with it. For the first time in years, I was consistent. And consistency beat intensity every single time.

## The Math of 'Good Enough'

- Perfect plan followed for 3 weeks = 18 workouts, then 0
- Good enough plan followed for 12 months = 150+ workouts
- Guess which one gets better results?

## What 'Good Enough' Looks Like

For me, good enough means: train 3-4 times a week, eat mostly whole foods, get 7+ hours of sleep most nights, walk daily, and don't stress the rest. Some weeks are better than others. That's fine. The trend line is what matters, not any single day.

Give yourself permission to be imperfect. It's the most productive thing you'll ever do for your health.
