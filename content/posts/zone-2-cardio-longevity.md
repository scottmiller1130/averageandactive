Zone 2 cardio is the most boring and most important type of exercise I do. It's not sexy. There's no before-and-after transformation. But the science behind it for longevity is overwhelming.

## What Is Zone 2?

Zone 2 is the intensity where you can hold a conversation but it's slightly uncomfortable. You're breathing harder but you're not gasping. For most people, that's a brisk walk, an easy jog, or a moderate bike ride. Heart rate roughly 60-70% of your max.

## Why It Matters

Zone 2 training improves your mitochondrial function — basically, how efficiently your cells produce energy. It improves insulin sensitivity, cardiovascular health, and fat metabolism. Dr. Peter Attia calls it 'the most important exercise for longevity,' and after digging into the research, I agree.

## How I Fit It In

- 3-4 times per week, 30-45 minutes each
- Usually a walk with the dog or a bike ride on the weekend
- Sometimes I just walk on an incline treadmill while watching a show
- I wear a cheap heart rate monitor to stay in the right zone

The beauty of zone 2 is that it doesn't beat you up. You can do it every day without affecting your recovery. It's the opposite of 'no pain, no gain' — and it's arguably more important for your long-term health than any heavy lifting session.

## The Dad Walk

My favorite zone 2 session? Walking the neighborhood with my kids on their bikes. They ride, I walk fast, we all get outside. Exercise that doubles as family time? That's the sweet spot.
