Today kicks off another social platform around fitness, health, family, food, etc. Here are the reasons this one is different than the masses.

## 1. Not enough real

I follow a lot of fitness influencers across multiple platforms. I have respect for each of them but have quickly found they are all peak level athletes in their youth. It is great to watch their journeys but I quickly feel defeated in my own journey.

## 2. Unrelatable

A lot of the current content out in the wild is unrelatable, at least for me. I find it hard to relate to pro athletes, I find it hard to relate to someone that doesn't have kids, I find it hard to relate to someone much younger, I find it hard to relate to athletes in their peak era, and I find it hard to relate to someone that has their career around fitness. As said above, I respect their journeys but they are all very hard to relate to in my current stage of life.

## 3. Pushing product

Once I find someone that I can relate to, over time, they start to push products. Products that make them money. Products that don't help my journey. It becomes more of an ad than actual content. That is not my goal here, my goal is to share my journey and make it accessible. I don't want to push ads as ads already exist within platforms. You don't need more ads. You need more content that matters.

## 4. Posting the hard

At times, the influencers push the good and not the bad. Life is hard, we need to see it all. The journey has peaks and valleys. It isn't all rainbows and sunshine. I want my content to be real and felt. I want mistakes to be shown, losses to be felt and relatable.

## 5. Tired of the fake

I don't like the filters, I don't like the perfect lighting. As you follow people, you realize how easily a good day, lighting, and time of the day can turn into a picture that shows extreme progress. I love progress but nothing happens fast. It takes work, consistency, and time.

Overall, I am here to share my journey, make it relatable, make it felt and interact with others on a similar path. I am not here to push ads, I am not here to push products, and I am not looking to "influence" others.
