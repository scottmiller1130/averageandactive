Today kicks off another social platform around fitness, health, family, food etc. 

## 1. Not enough real

Barbell, goblet, bodyweight — doesn't matter. Squatting keeps your legs strong, your knees healthy, and your ability to get off the floor intact as you age. I do goblet squats with a dumbbell 2x per week. Nothing fancy.

## 2. Unrelatable

Picking heavy stuff off the ground. This builds your back, glutes, and hamstrings — the muscles that protect your spine when you're lifting kids, groceries, or furniture. Romanian deadlifts with dumbbells are my go-to.

## 3. Pushing product

Upper body pushing. Bench press, push-ups, overhead press — pick one or rotate. This keeps your chest, shoulders, and arms strong for carrying kids, pushing strollers, and everyday life.

## 4. Posting the hard

The counterbalance to all that pushing (and all that sitting at a desk). Rows and pull-ups build the back muscles that keep your posture solid. I do dumbbell rows every upper body day.

## 5. Tired of the fake
